# {Description}
The attacker sets up a rogue LTE base station to (1)obtain the IMSI of 5G user equipment and can also (2)launch DoS and (3)service downgrade attack.

# {Product}
ASUS ZenFone 7

# {POC}
## 1. Set up micro base station 
Set up SDR:  
(1) Computer with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS 64-bit  
(2) srsRAN https://github.com/srsran/srsRAN_4G  
(3) USRP B210  
  
Collecting legitimate base station information:  
Can use app "LTE Discovery" to collect https://ltediscovery.dev/home  
Record (1)MCC (2)MNC (3)EARFCN

## 2. Vulnerabilities  
**IMSI Disclosure**  
Start the micro base station, UE will attach to it.  
Once UE attach micro base station, the IMSI of UE will be able to capture.
